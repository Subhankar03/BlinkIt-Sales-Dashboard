## Project Overview

This project involves the development of an interactive sales dashboard in Microsoft Excel for Blinkit,
a last-minute grocery delivery service. The dashboard provides key business insights by aggregating
sales data and presenting it through visually appealing charts, KPIs, and interactive filters.

Designed to be intuitive and data-driven, this dashboard allows stakeholders to track performance trends,
compare sales across different outlet sizes and locations, and analyze product category performance.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project was to create a centralized dashboard that:  
✅ Displays key sales metrics such as total sales, average sales, and items sold.  
✅ Provides visual breakdowns of sales by outlet type, size, and location.  
✅ Enables quick filtering and insights with interactive options for easy data exploration.  
✅ Enhances data-driven decision-making with clear, well-structured visualizations.

## Methodology

* Tools Used: **Microsoft Excel, Pivot Tables, Formulas, Charts, Interactive Slicers**.

* Identified the **key performance indicators (KPIs)** to be displayed.

* Defined filter categories: **Outlet Size, Outlet Location, and Item Type**.

* Cleaned and formatted raw sales data for consistency.

* Used pivot tables to summarize total sales and categorize them by different factors.

* Calculated average sales, item counts, and ratings using Excel formulas.

* Created customized charts (bar charts, donut charts, and line graphs) to display sales trends.

* Used color gradients and subtle shadows to enhance the dashboard's visual appeal.

* Added interactive slicers for dynamic filtering by outlet size and location.

## Key Takeaways

* **Fruits & Vegetables** and **Snack Foods** are top-selling categories, driving the most revenue.

* **Medium-sized outlets** perform best, generating over **$500K** in sales.

* **Tier 3 cities** lead with **$472.1K** in sales, showing strong demand in smaller markets.

* **Neighborhood Market** is the highest-grossing outlet type.

* Sales peaked in **2018**, with consistent performance in other years.

* **Average sales** remain balanced across outlet types (~$140).

* **Seafood** and **Breakfast items** are low performers and may need strategic review.

## Conclusion

This Blinkit Sales Dashboard showcases my skills in data visualization, analytical storytelling,
and dashboard design using Microsoft Excel. It transforms raw sales data into an actionable,
interactive tool that supports data-driven business decisions.
